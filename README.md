# Two Way Traffic Light.

## Group Project for CDA 3104 - Comp Organization & Assembly Language Programming.

### Simulation of a 2-way traffic light intersection. The program was written using the AVR assembly programming language. Timers were used to control the traffic light delays.

### In this group project, I worked with Ragy Costa De Jesus and Anthony Zarzana.
